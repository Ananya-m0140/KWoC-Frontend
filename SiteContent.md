## Testimonials

KWoC '17 was my first mentoring experience and I enjoyed working with  talented people who had the zeal and vigour to learn new things. Some of  my mentees were also accepted as GSoC '18 students, which makes me  proud and happy in the true sense of the word. It's a great initiative  by KOSS to promote the open source culture among students and I hope the  next version achieves greater heights and influences more lives. 

Aniq Ur Rahman  *[ KWoC '17 Mentor ]*

 I had a really good  time at KWoC '17. My projects prospered well because of inputs from  participants. Regular chaperoning from KOSS maintained that the quality  of the coding program never touched a low point and maintained the  coding frequency consistent throughout the program. 

Dhruv Apte  *[ KWoC '17 Mentor ]* 

[Blog](https://the-ethan-hunt.github.io/about/)



My project was a  normal one before KWOC, something I had worked on in a hackathon. But I  loved the idea but found it hard to do alone. But due to KWoC I got very  good quality amazing contributors who helped to changed that small  project into a top 3 product in Product Hunt and featured in many tech  publications. 

Gautham Santhosh  *[ KWoC '17 Mentor ]*

The experience has  been great both the years, with a lot of new students learning  open-source development from KWoC by contributing to the projects. Some  of my mentees have even gone ahead to do a GSoC project as well in the  following summers, and are definitely are still actively contributing to  open-source.
