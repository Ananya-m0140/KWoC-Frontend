Some of my mentees were also accepted as GSoC '18 students,which makes me proud and happy in the true sense of the word. It's a great initiative by KOSS to promote the open source culture among students and I hope the next version achieves greater heights and influences more lives.",

Regular chaperoning from KOSS maintained that the quality of the coding program never touched alow point and maintained the coding frequency consistent throughout           the program.",

But due to KWoC I got very good quality amazing contributors who            helped to changed that small project into a top 3 product in ProductHunt and featured in many tech publications.",
